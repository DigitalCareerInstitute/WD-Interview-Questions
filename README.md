# Interview Questions Preperation

In this repository you will find a collection of questions that have been asked in actual job interviews. You will find the questions in [QUESTIONS.md](./QUESTIONS.md) and example answers in [ANSWERS.md](./ANSWERS.md).

Usually you only have a few minutes to answer. To quiz yourself before looking at the example answers, go through each question and write down your current answer. You can then choose to check the example answers or research the topics yourself!

Insider tip from someone who does technical job interviews: it's much better to say "I don't know" than guessing an incorrect answer. Don't worry if you can't answer all questions, we are only human! Sometimes we recruiters even ask intentionally weird questions to test your reaction!

## Bonus Markdown tips!

- [useful markdown commands](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [create cool diagrams with markdown](https://support.typora.io/Draw-Diagrams-With-Markdown/)
    - The diagrams might require a plugin to work but they do work when rendered in GitHub

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

- Markdown can do tables too

    **Table 1**

    | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
    | :------------ |:-------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
    | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
    | col 1 is      | left-aligned  |    $1 |

    **Table 2**

    This one | is a less | pretty table
    --- | :-: | ---
    *But it still* | `renders` | **quite nicely**
    1 | 2 | 3
